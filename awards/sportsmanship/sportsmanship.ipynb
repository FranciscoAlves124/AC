    "Unlike MVP or Scoring titles which are purely performance-based, the Sportsmanship Award honors players who exemplify ethical behavior and integrity. In basketball analytics, this is typically modeled as:\n",
    "* **High Availability:** Playing significant minutes (essential to the team).\n",
    "* **Low Conflict:** Committing very few personal fouls or technical fouls relative to playing time.\n",
    "* **High Performance:** Generally, awards go to recognized, high-quality players (All-Stars), not bench warmers.\n",

    "**Data Sources**\n",
    "* **`players_teams`**: Granular statistics (Minutes, PF, DQ, etc.) to model behavior.\n",
